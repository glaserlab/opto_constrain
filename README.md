# Overview

This repository contains code used for analyses in the paper "Constraining inferences of across-region interactions using neural activity perturbations". 

This repository also contains an example notebook (`example.ipynb`) and a partial dataset (pickle files in data) used to run examples of the main analyses used in the paper.

## Installation

1) Pull repo

2) Install packages listed in `requirements.txt`

3) Install src package by navigating to root directory of this repo and running `pip install -e .`

4) The pickle files in the data folder (needed for running `example.ipynb`) likely won't automatically download when pulling the repo unless Git LFS is installed. If not, these can be downloaded manually from the repo (navigate to each .pickle file, and click download from dropdown menu), and place in data folder.
