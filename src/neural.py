    Function that puts spikes into bins
	Stolen from Josh's Neural_Decoding.preprocessing_funcs, modified to work on list of arrays

    Parameters
    ----------
    spike_times: an array of arrays
        an array of neurons. within each neuron's array is an array containing all the spike times of that neuron
    dt: number (any format)
        size of time bins
    wdw_start: number (any format)
        the start time for putting spikes in bins
    wdw_end: number (any format)
        the end time for putting spikes in bins
